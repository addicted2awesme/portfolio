						<h2>Mountain Hardwear.com</h2>

						<div class="project-blurb">
							<p>I was heavily involved in the rebuilding and subsequent launching of the 2012 <a href="http://www.montainhardear.com">Mountain Hardwear.com</a> refreshed ecommerce site, I also built the inspiration section of the site which is WordPress based and needed to be custom configured for the needs of the business users. In 2014 I played a key role in the relaunch of the newest MHW site which is responsive and operates on a unified code base with the other CSC sites.</p>

						<div class="project-blurb">
							<p>I have worked closely with this company for many years now and it has been a pleasure to help them build their online presence. The site was done on a minimal budget but we (I had the help of a talented Portland designer) were able to deliver the client a clean, functional, and inviting site that was molded to the experience they wanted for their users. It was built utilizing Bootstrap functionality as well as HTML5 and CSS3.</p>

						<h2>Columbia Sportswear</h2>
						<div class="project-blurb">
							<img class="screengrab" src="img/columbia.png"/>
							<p>Columbia Sportswear is a staple in the Northwest and I have had a wonderful time working on a wide variety of initiatives and projects with them. I have worked for them as both a contracted company as well as a full time employee. Working on a site that is translated into 5 different languages and conducts business in over 20 countries has unique challenges and has really helped me expand my skills and problem solving abilities. In 2014 I played a main role in rebuilding this and the other CSC sites with a unified code base and a responsive design.</p>

						<h2>Resnick Sustainability Institute | CalTech</h2>
						<div class="project-blurb">
							<img class="screengrab" src="img/resnick.png"/>
							<p>This site was really awesome to work on! The crew down at CalTech was a pleasure to interact with and they were very receptive to the input from myself and the lead-designer. Since the Resnick Institute (CalTech's sustainability focused research and development branch) hosts a very large amount and variety of information on their site, it was quite the task to develop a responsive site that would work well for all their needs. </p>

							<img class="screengrab" src="img/sorel.png"/>
							<p>Working on high-fashion sites is not something I would ever have thought I would do but it turns out to be really fun! I have been able work with them on a number of campaigns including the 2012 "Get Your Boots Dirty" initiative which was highly successful and helped the company put one of (if not the most) successful years in the books.</p>

						<h2>The Suite Barbershop</h2>
						<div class="project-blurb">
							<img class="screengrab" src="img/thesuite.png"/>
							<p>I have had the pleasure of doing a few iterations of this site and am really happy with where it has ended up. Aside from the development work I also did all the design and strategy work. The online experience focuses on the mobile user (about 80% of all users access the site via mobile). I made sure it loads fast, is easy to navigate, and caters to the needs of the user.</p>

						<h2>Icebreaker</h2>

							<img class="screengrab" src="img/icebreaker.jpg"/>
							<p>I designed and built the main portal entrance for Icebreakers Business-to-Business site. This is where retailers like REI would go to see the upcoming seasons product and place orders. Instead of just having a simple sign in I opted to also integrate a small seasonal lookbook which was very well received. </p>
