							<p>In addition to being heavily involved in the rebuilding and subsequent launching of the 2012 <a href="http://www.montainhardear.com">MountainHardwear.com</a> refreshed ecommerce site, I also built the inspiration section of the site which is WordPress based and needed to be custom configured for the needs of the business users.</p>

						<div class="project-blurb">
							<p>I have worked closely with this company for many years now and it has been a pleasure to help them build their online presence. The site was done on a minimal budget but we (I had the help of a talented Portland designer) were able to deliver the client a clean, functional, and inviting site that was molded to the experience they wanted for their users. It was built utilizing Bootstrap functionality as well as HTML5 and CSS3.</p>

						<h2>Columbia Sportswear</h2>
						<div class="project-blurb">
							<img class="screengrab" src="img/columbia.png"/>
							<p>Columbia Sportswear is a staple in the Northwest and I have had a wonderful time working on a wide variety of initiatives and projects with them. I have worked for them as both a contracted company as well as a full time employee. Working on a site that is translated into 5 different languages and conducts business in over 20 countries has unique challenges and has really helped me expand my skills and problem solving abilities.</p>

						<h2>Resnick Sustainability Institute | CalTech</h2>
						<div class="project-blurb">
							<img class="screengrab" src="img/resnick.png"/>
							<p>This site was really awesome to work on! The crew down at CalTech was a pleasure to interact with and they were very receptive to the input from myself and the lead-designer. Since the Resnick Institute (CalTech's sustainability focused research and development branch) hosts a very large amount and variety of information on their site, it was quite the task to develop a responsive site that would work well for all their needs. </p>

						<h2>SOREL</h2>
						<div class="project-blurb">
							<img class="screengrab" src="img/sorel.png"/>
							<p>Working on high-fashion sites is not something I would ever have thought I would do but it turns out to be really fun! I have been able work with them on a number of campaigns including the 2012 "Get Your Boots Dirty" initiative which was highly successful and helped the company put one of (if not the most) successful years in the books.</p>

						<h2>Montrail Footwear</h2>

						<h2>Icebreaker</h2>
						<div class="project-blurb">
							<img class="screengrab" src="img/icebreaker.jpg"/>
							<p>I designed and built the main portal entrance for Icebreakers Business-to-Business site. This is where retailers like REI would go to see the upcoming seasons product and place orders. Instead of just having a simple sign in I opted to also integrate a small seasonal lookbook which was very well received. </p>

						<h2>Organic City Sounds</h2>
						<div class="project-blurb">
							<img class="screengrab" src="img/organicCitySounds.jpg"/>
							<p>This was a very special project for me. The client happened to be a close friend of mine who was interested in creating an audio blog that focused on all that is awesome about Portland, Oregon. With the support of SoundCloud we were able to get it off the ground and produce a really stellar experience. The site itself was pretty simple but it was nice to work with different ways of presenting the user with audio listening environments.</p>
